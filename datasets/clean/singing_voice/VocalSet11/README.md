Dataset name: VocalSet: A Singing Voice Dataset 

This data was downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/1193957#.X1hkxYtlCHs
We resampled the audio to 16kHz mono audio .WAV files. 

VocalSet, a singing voice dataset contains 10.1 hours of monophonic recorded audio of professional singers demonstrating both standard and extended vocal techniques on all 5 vowels. Existing singing voice datasets aim to capture a focused subset of singing voice characteristics, and generally consist of just a few singers. VocalSet contains recordings from 20 different singers (9 male, 11 female) and a range of voice types.  VocalSet aims to improve the state of existing singing voice datasets and singing voice research by capturing not only a range of vowels, but also a diverse set of voices on many different vocal techniques, sung in contexts of scales, arpeggios, long tones, and excerpts.

We have included two .rtf files test_singers and train_singers in which you will find a list of the singers we used to train and test the majority of our deep learning models on.
